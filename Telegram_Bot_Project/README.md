Rock Paper Scissors Game in Telegram Bot


What's about: 
Telegram Chatbot that plays Rock Paper Scissors with you.

The user starts playing with the bot by sending an image of his own hand showing Rock, Paper or Scissors. The trained model will predict what
is that image representing and return if the user won, tied or lost.

This project was developed in 2 different ways but basically with the same result other than the accuracy of prediction.

RPS_CNN - The data was trained on a convolutional neural network model.

RPS_ML - The data was trained using a recursive machine learning model.

How to run it:

1) Create a bot on telegram and use the token provided in main.py (RPS_ML) and main_bot.py (RPS_CNN)
2) Find the bot in the telegram app
3) Start playing
4) Send an image of your hand with Rock, Paper or Scissors with a white background and about 30-50 cm from the camera
