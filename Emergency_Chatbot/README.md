# Emergency Chatbot

I needed help. And Gloria did help me:

## What's about: 
A chatbot that helps people with medical emergencies and schedule appointments.

I used an NLP model to predict what does the patient need using tags for it.

I applied bag_of_words to index all the words in the intents.json file and exported the trained model weights as trained.pth.


##Â How to run it:

1. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run streamlit and ask for help or an appointment:
```
streamlit run chat.py
```

3. Start chatting with Gloria. The bot nurse.


Any questions?

Just hit me up.
