Emergency CHATBOT


What's about: 
A chatbot that helps people with medical emergencies.

I used an NLP model to predict what does the patient need.
I applied bag_of_words to index all the words in the intents.json file and export the trained model.

How to run it:
Run chat.py in terminal and engage with it.

Any questions?

Just hit me up.
