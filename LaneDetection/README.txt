Computer Vision for Lane Detection


What's about: 
Giving car camera frame of a video this algorithm will identify the lane on the road.
Since a video is a series of frames together its also able to identify it in the video.



How to run it:

1) You can choose a frame of a road or a full video.
2) On main.py just substitute the test_image link (for an image) and the cap link (for a video)
3) Execute only the part you want to test commenting the other
4) Execute the file and wait for the video software to open

Have fun!
